## My notes

[Got it reading the json, finally](https://play.golang.org/p/1uR4FLTchA).
This is where I found out I'll have to change the casing on the 
section headers in the JSON.

After some messing around trying to get go to parse my data file, 
I finally got it going. I bit off a little more than I could chew
to start, but this was a good exercise. Go is not javascript. :-)

The `for` structure is similar to the `foreach` in C#, but different
in syntax. I like the `_` structure as way of dealing with unneeded
returns from functions. 

[I'm snapshotting this now](https://play.golang.org/p/bpvjBNronw).
