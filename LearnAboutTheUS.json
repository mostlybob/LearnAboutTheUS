      "AdditionalInfo": "The Founding Fathers of the United States wrote the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution is the \"supreme law of the land.\" The U.S. Constitution has lasted longer than any other country’s constitution. It establishes the basic principles of the United States government. The Constitution establishes a system of government called \"representative democracy.\" In a representative democracy, citizens choose representatives to make the laws. U.S. citizens also choose a president to lead the executive branch of government. The Constitution lists fundamental rights for all citizens and other people living in the United States. Laws made in the United States must follow the Constitution."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The Constitution of the United States divides government power between the national government and state governments. The name for this division of power is \"federalism.\" Federalism is an important idea in the Constitution. We call the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution the \"Framers\" of the Constitution. The Framers wanted to limit the powers of the government, so they separated the powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Constitution explains the power of each branch. The Constitution also includes changes and additions, called \"amendments.\" The first 10 amendments are called the \"Bill of Rights.\" The Bill of Rights established the individual rights and liberties of all Americans."

The government works for the people and protects the rights of people. In the United States, the power to govern comes from the people, who are the highest power. This is called \"popular sovereignty.\" The people elect representatives to make laws."

        "a change (to the Constitution)",
        "an addition (to the Constitution)"
      ],
      "AdditionalInfo": "An amendment is a change or addition to the Constitution. The Framers of the Constitution knew that laws can change as a country grows. They did not want to make it too easy to modify the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. The Framers also did not want the Constitution to lose its meaning. For this reason, the Framers decided that Congress could pass amendments in only two ways: by a two-thirds vote in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives or by a special convention. A special convention has to be requested by two-thirds of the states. After an amendment has passed in Congress or by a special convention, the amendment must then be ratified (accepted) by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. The amendment can also be ratified by a special convention in three-fourths of the states. Not all proposed amendments are ratified. Six times in U.S. history amendments have passed in Congress but were not approved by enough states to be ratified."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. When the Framers wrote the Constitution, they did not focus on individual rights. They focused on creating the system and structure of government. Many Americans believed that the Constitution should guarantee the rights of the people, and they wanted a list of all the things a government could not do. They were afraid that a strong government would take away the rights people won in the Revolutionary War. James Madison, one of the Framers of the Constitution, wrote a list of individual rights and limits on the government. These rights appear in the first 10 amendments, called the Bill of Rights. Some of these rights include freedom of expression, the right to bear arms, freedom from search without warrant, freedom not to be tried twice for the same crime, the right to not testify against yourself, the right to a trial by a jury of your peers, the right to an attorney, and protection against excessive fines and unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791."

Open discussion and debate are important to democracy. The First Amendment also protects freedom of religion and free speech. This amendment says that Congress may not pass laws that establish an official religion and may not limit religious expression. Congress may not pass laws that limit freedom of the press or the right of people to meet peacefully. The First Amendment also gives people the right to petition the government to change laws or acts that are not fair. Congress may not take away these rights. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees and protects these rights."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The Declaration of Independence contains important ideas about the American system of government. The Declaration of Independence states that all people are created equal and have \"certain unalienable rights.\" These are rights that no government can change or take away. The author of the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson, wrote that the American colonies should be independent because Great Britain did not respect the basic rights of people in the colonies. Jefferson believed that a government exists only if the people think it should. He believed in the idea that the people create their own government and consent, or agree, to follow laws their government makes. This idea is called \"consent of the governed.\" If the government creates laws that are fair and protect people, then people will agree to follow those laws. In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote a list of complaints the colonists had against the King of England. Jefferson ended the Declaration with the statement that the colonies are, and should be, free and independent states. The Second Continental Congress voted to accept the Declaration on July 4, 1776."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The Declaration of Independence lists three rights that the Founding Fathers considered to be natural and \"unalienable.\" They are the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These ideas about freedom and individual rights were the basis for declaring America’s independence. Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers believed that people are born with natural rights that no government can take away. Government exists to protect these rights. Because the people voluntarily give up power to a government, they can take that power back. The British government was not protecting the rights of the colonists, so the colonies took back their power and separated from Great Britain."

        "You can practice any religion, or not practice a religion. "
      ],
      "AdditionalInfo": "Colonists from Spain, France, Holland, England, and other countries came to America for many different reasons. One of the reasons was religious freedom. The rulers of many of these countries told their citizens that they must go to a certain church and worship in a certain way. Some people had different religious beliefs than their rulers and wanted to have their own churches. In 1620, the Pilgrims were the first group that came to America seeking religious freedom. Religious freedom was also important to the Framers. For this reason, freedom of religion was included in the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. The First Amendment states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" The First Amendment also prohibits Congress from setting up an official U.S. religion, and protects citizens’ rights to hold any religious belief, or none at all."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The economic system of the United States is capitalism. In the American economy, most businesses are privately owned. Competition and profit motivate businesses. Businesses and consumers interact in the marketplace, where prices can be negotiated. This is called a \"market economy.\" In a market economy, businesses decide what to produce, how much to produce, and what to charge. Consumers decide what, when, and where they will buy goods or services. In a market economy, competition, supply, and demand influence the decisions of businesses and consumers."

He wrote that our country is, \"a government of laws, and not of men.\" No person or group is above the law. The rule of law means that everyone (citizens and leaders) must obey the laws. In the United States, the U.S. Constitution is the foundation for the rule of law. The United States is a \"constitutional democracy\" (a democracy with a constitution). In constitutional democracies, people are willing to obey the laws because the laws are made by the people through their elected representatives. If all people are governed by the same laws, the individual rights and liberties of each person are better protected. The rule of law helps to make sure that government protects all people equally and does not violate the rights of certain people."

Article I explains that Congress makes laws. Congress (the Senate and the House of Representatives) is the legislative branch of the U.S. government. Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch. The executive branch enforces the laws that Congress passes. The executive branch makes sure all the people follow the laws of the United States. The president is the head of the executive branch. The vice president and members of the president’s cabinet are also part of the executive branch. Article III of the Constitution establishes the judicial branch. The judicial branch places the highest judicial power in the Supreme Court. One responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide if government laws and actions follow the Constitution. This is a very important responsibility."

      ],
      "AdditionalInfo": "The Constitution separates the government’s power into three branches to prevent one person or group from having too much power. The separation of government into three branches creates a system of checks and balances. This means that each branch can block, or threaten to block, the actions of the other branches. Here are some examples: the Senate (part of the legislative branch) can block a treaty signed by the president (the executive branch). In this example, the legislative branch is \"checking\" the executive. The U.S. Supreme Court (the judicial branch) can reject a law passed by Congress (the legislative branch). In this example, the judicial branch is \"checking\" the legislative branch. This separation of powers limits the power of the government and prevents the government from violating the rights of the people."

The president is both the head of state and the head of government. The president’s powers include the ability to sign treaties with other countries and to select ambassadors to represent the United States around the world. The president also sets national policies and proposes laws to Congress. The president names the top leaders of the federal departments. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme  Court, the president names a new member. However, the Senate has the power to reject the president’s choices. This limit on the power of the president is an example of checks and balances."

      "AdditionalInfo": "Congress makes federal laws. A federal law usually applies to all states and all people in the United States. Either side of Congress—the Senate or the House of Representatives—can propose a bill to address an issue. When the Senate proposes a bill, it sends the bill to a Senate committee. The Senate committee studies the issue and the bill. When the House of Representatives proposes a bill, it sends the bill to a House of Representatives committee. The committee studies the bill and sometimes makes changes to it. Then the bill goes to the full House or Senate for consideration. When each chamber passes its own version of the bill, it often goes to a \"conference committee.\" The conference committee has members from both the House and the Senate. This committee discusses the bill, tries to resolve the differences, and writes a report with the final version of the bill. Then the committee sends the final version of the bill back to both houses for approval. If both houses approve the bill, it is considered \"enrolled.\" An enrolled bill goes to the president to be signed into law. If the president signs the bill, it becomes a federal law."

The system of checks and balances works in Congress. Specific powers are assigned to each of these chambers. For example, only the Senate has the power to reject a treaty signed by the president or a person the president chooses to serve on the Supreme Court. Only the House of Representatives has the power to introduce a bill that requires Americans to pay taxes."

      "AdditionalInfo": "There are 100 senators in Congress, two from each state. All states have equal power in the Senate because each state has the same number of senators. States with a very small population have the same number of senators as states with very large populations. The Framers of the Constitution made sure that the Senate would be small. This would keep it more orderly than the larger House of Representatives. As James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper #63, the Senate should be a \"temperate and respectable body of citizens\" that operates in a \"cool and deliberate\" way."

They also wanted longer Senate terms to balance the shorter two-year terms of the members of the House, who would more closely follow public opinion. The Constitution puts no limit on the number of terms a senator may serve. Elections for U.S. senators take place on even-numbered years.

However, the distribution of members among the states has changed over the years. Each state must have at least one representative in the House. Beyond that, the number of representatives from each state depends on the population of the state. The Constitution says that the government will conduct a census of the population every 10 years to count the number of people in each state. The results of the census are used to recalculate the number of representatives each state should have. For example, if one state gains many residents that state could get one or more new representatives. If another state loses residents, that state could lose one or more. But the total number of voting U.S. representatives does not change."

Because of this, they limited the powers of the head of the new U.S. government. They decided that the people would elect the president every four years.  The president is the only official elected by the entire country through the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a process that was designed by the writers of the Constitution to select presidents. It came from a compromise between the president being elected directly by the people and the president being chosen by Congress. Citizens vote for electors, who then choose the president. Before 1951, there was no limit on the number of terms a president could serve.

Congress chose November because the United States was mostly rural. By November, farmers had completed their harvests and were available to vote. Another reason for this date was the weather. People were able to travel because it was not yet winter. They chose Tuesday for Election Day so that voters had a full day after Sunday to travel to the polls."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The Founding Fathers strongly believed in republican ideals. A republic is a government where a country’s political power comes from the citizens, not the rulers, and is put into use by representatives elected by the citizens. That is why they made the president the commander in chief. They wanted a civilian selected by the people. They did not want a professional military leader. The president commands the armed forces, but Congress has the power to pay for the armed forces and declare war. In 1973, many members of Congress believed that the president was misusing or abusing his powers as commander in chief. They thought that the president was ignoring the legislative branch and not allowing the system of checks and balances to work. In response, Congress passed the War Powers Act. The War Powers Act gave Congress a stronger voice in decisions about the use of U.S. troops. President Richard Nixon vetoed this bill, but Congress overrode his veto. Because we have a system of checks and balances, one branch of government is able to check the other branches."

When the Senate or House begins to debate the proposal, it is called a \"bill.\" After debate in both houses of Congress, if a majority of both the Senate and House vote to pass the bill, it goes to the president. If the president wants the bill to become law, he signs it. If the president does not want the bill to become law, he vetoes it. The president cannot introduce a bill. If he has an idea for a bill, he must ask a member of Congress to introduce it."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The president has veto power. This means that the president can reject a bill passed by Congress. If the president vetoes a bill, he prevents it from becoming a law. The president can send the bill back to Congress unsigned. Often he will list reasons why he rejects it. The president has 10 days to evaluate the bill. If the president does not sign the bill after 10 days and Congress is in session, the bill automatically becomes a law. If the president does nothing with the bill and Congress adjourns within the 10-day period, the bill does not become law—this is called a \"pocket veto.\" If two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate vote to pass the bill again, the bill becomes a law, even though the president did not sign it. This process is called \"overriding the president's veto.\" It is not easy to do."

This was only temporary. In 1894, a flat-rate federal income tax was enacted, but the Supreme Court said this was unconstitutional. Finally, in 1913, the 16th Amendment was ratified. It gave Congress the power to collect income taxes. Today, \"taxable income\" is money that is earned from wages, self-employment, tips, and the sale of property. The government uses these taxes to keep our country safe and secure. It also tries to cure and prevent diseases through research.

The British taxed the colonists without their consent, and the colonists had nobody to represent their needs and ideas to the British government. They were also angry because ordinary colonists were forced to let British soldiers sleep and eat in their homes. The colonists believed the British did not respect their basic rights. The British governed the colonists without their consent, denying them self-government."

Another important idea is that people are born with certain rights including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Jefferson was the third president of the United States, serving from 1801 to 1809. Before becoming president, Jefferson was governor of Virginia and the first U.S. secretary of state. He strongly supported individual rights, especially freedom of religion. Jefferson wanted to protect these rights. For this reason, he did not want a strong national government."

These representatives were angry about British laws that treated them unfairly. They began to organize an army. The Second Continental Congress met in 1775 after fighting began between the colonists and the British Army. This Congress asked Thomas Jefferson and others to write the Declaration of Independence. When Thomas Jefferson finished his draft of the Declaration of Independence, he took it to John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and the others on the committee to review it. After changes were made by the committee, the Declaration was read to the members of the entire Congress. The purpose of the Declaration was to announce the separation of the colonies from England. The Declaration of Independence stated that if a government does not protect the rights of the people, the people can create a new government. For this reason, the colonists separated from their British rulers. On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence."

      "AdditionalInfo": "The United States fought four major wars in the 
1800s—the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, 
the Civil War, and the Spanish-American War. 
The War of 1812 lasted from 1812 through 1815. 
President James Madison asked Congress to declare 
war on Great Britain. The British were stopping 
and seizing American ships. They were also arming 
American Indians to fight against the Americans. As 
a result of this war, the nation’s trade was disrupted and the U.S. Capitol was burned. The Americans won 
the war. This was the first time after the Revolutionary 
War that America had to fight a foreign country to 
protect its independence.
The Mexican-American War was a conflict between 
Mexico and America. The war began in Texas in 
1846. President James Polk ordered General Zachary 
Taylor and his forces to occupy land claimed by both 
the United States and Mexico. President Polk believed 
westward expansion was important for the United 
States to grow. When Mexico attacked, the United 
States went to war with Mexico. When the war ended 
in February 1848, the United States and Mexico signed 
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. This treaty gave 
Texas to the United States and extended the boundaries 
of the United States west to the Pacific Ocean. 
In the Civil War, the people of the United States 
fought against each other. Americans in the northern 
states fought to support the federal government 
(“the Union”) against Americans from the southern 
states. The southern states were trying to separate 
themselves to form a new nation, the Confederate 
States of America (“the Confederacy”). The war lasted 
from 1861 to 1865, when the Confederate army 
surrendered to the Union army. Many lives were lost 
in the American Civil War.
In 1898, the United States fought Spain in the Spanish-
American War. The United States wanted to help 
Cuba become independent from Spain because the 
United States had economic interests in Cuba. The 
war began when a U.S. battleship was sunk near 
Cuba. Many Americans believed it was the Spanish 
who attacked the ship. For this reason, America went 
to war with Spain. By the end of 1898, the war was 
over with a victory for the United States. Cuba had 
its independence, and Guam, Puerto Rico, and the 
Philippines became territories of the United States."

Richmond, Virginia. Confederate General Robert E. 
Lee surrendered to Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant of the

based economy depended heavily on slave labor. 
The southern states feared that the United States 
government would end slavery. The southern states 
believed that this would hurt their economic and 
political independence. The economy of the northern 
states was more industrial and did not depend on 
slavery. The northern states fought to keep all the 
United States together in “the Union.” They tried to 
stop the southern states from separating into a new 
Confederate nation. There were also many people 
in the North who wanted to end slavery. These

World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the 
Vietnam War, and the (Persian) Gulf War. World War I began in 1914. It was a long and 
bloody struggle. The United States entered the war 
in 1917 after German submarines attacked British 
and U.S. ships, and the Germans contacted Mexico 
about starting a war against the United States. The 
war ended in 1918 when the Allied Powers (led by 
Britain, France, Italy, and the United States) defeated 
the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, 
and the Ottoman Empire). The Treaty of Versailles 
officially ended the war in 1919. World War I was 
called “the war to end all wars.”\nWorld War II began in 1939 when Germany invaded 
Poland. France and Great Britain then declared war 
on Germany. Germany had alliances with Italy and 
Japan, and together they formed the Axis powers. The 
United States entered World War II in 1941, after the 
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The United 
States joined France, Great Britain, and the Soviet 
Union as the Allied powers and led the 1944 invasion 
of France known as D-Day. The liberation of Europe 
from German power was completed by May 1945. 
World War II did not end until Japan surrendered in 
September 1945.\nThe Korean War began in 1950 when the North 
Korean Army moved across the 38th parallel into 
South Korea. The 38th parallel was a boundary 
established after World War II. This boundary 
separated the northern area of Korea, which was 
under communist influence, from the southern area 
of Korea, which was allied with the United States. 
At the time, the United States was providing support 
to establish a democratic South Korean government. 
The United States provided military support to stop 
the advance of the North Korean Army. In the Korean 
conflict, democratic governments directly confronted 
communist governments. The fighting ended in 1953, 
with the establishment of the countries of North Korea 
and South Korea.\nFrom 1959 to 1975, United States Armed Forces 
and the South Vietnamese Army fought against the 
North Vietnamese in the Vietnam War. The United 
States supported the democratic government in the 
south of the country to help it resist pressure from the 
communist north. The war ended in 1975 with the 
fall of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam. In 1976, Vietnam was under total communist control. Almost 
60,000 American men and women in the military died 
or were missing as a result of the Vietnam War.\nOn August 2, 1990, the Persian Gulf War began 
when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This invasion put the 
Iraqi Army closer to Saudi Arabia and its oil reserves, 
which supplied much of the world with oil. The 
United States and many other countries wanted to 
drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait and prevent it from 
invading other nearby countries. In January 1991, the 
United States led an international coalition of forces 
authorized by the United Nations into battle against 
the Iraqi Army. Within a month, the coalition had 
driven the Iraqis from Kuwait. The coalition declared a 
cease-fire on February 28, 1991."

(Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or USSR) was a 
powerful nation that operated under the principles of 
communism. The United States and its allies believed

expansion of communism to countries outside the 
Soviet Union. The Cold War began shortly after the

States began in 1954 when the Supreme Court 
ruled that racial segregation in public schools 
was unconstitutional. The goal of the civil rights 
movement was to end racial discrimination against African Americans and to gain full and equal rights 
for Americans of all races. Using nonviolent strategies 
such as bus boycotts, sit-ins, and marches, people 
came together to demand social change. As a result, 
Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Civil Rights 
Act made segregation in public facilities and racial 
discrimination in employment and education illegal. 
The law protects African Americans, women, and 
others from discrimination. The Voting Rights Act 
banned literacy tests and other special requirements 
that had been used to stop African Americans from 
registering to vote."

fort. He saw that the flag above the fort was still flying. 
This let him know that the British had not defeated 
the Americans. Key immediately wrote the words 
to a poem he called the “Defence of Fort M’Henry.” 
The words of the poem became “The Star-Spangled 
Banner.” Congress passed a law in 1931 naming “The 
Star-Spangled Banner” the official national anthem.
