        "additionalInfo":"The Constitution of the United States divides government power between the national government and state governments. The name for this division of power is \"federalism.\" Federalism is an important idea in the Constitution. We call the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution the \"Framers\" of the Constitution. The Framers wanted to limit the powers of the government, so they separated the powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Constitution explains the power of each branch. The Constitution also includes changes and additions, called \"amendments.\" The first 10 amendments are called the \"Bill of Rights.\" The Bill of Rights established the individual rights and liberties of all Americans."
